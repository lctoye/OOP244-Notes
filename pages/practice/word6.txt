	6.  Design  and  code  a  class  named  "animal",  which  stores
	    critical information about an  animal.  An  animal  has  the
	    following publicly accessible members:

	      void name(char s[]) - sets the animal's name to the string
		passed in s (e.g. "dog").

	      void name() - displays the animal's name on  the  standard
		output device.

	      void noise(char s[]) - sets the noise the animal makes  to
		the string passed in s (e.g. "woof").

	      void noise() - displays the animal's noise on the standard
		output device.

	    When  instantiated,  an  animal  should  be  initialized  to
	    "human" (for the name) and "ouch" (for the noise), unless  a
	    name and a noise (in that order) are supplied as parameters,
	    in which case the supplied name and noise are used.

	    Also, write a function

	      void OldMac(animal)

	    which displays a version of the song "Old MacDonald's  Farm"
	    on the standard output device.

	    For example the code:

		animal x("duck", "quack");
		OldMac(x);

	    would output:

		Old MacDonald had a farm, EIEIO
		And on that farm he had a duck, EIEIO
		With a quack, quack here
		And a quack, quack there
		Here a quack, there a quack
		Everywhere a quack, quack
		Old MacDonald had a farm, EIEIO

	    Of course, everywhere that "duck" appears should be replaced
	    with the animal's name, and everywhere that "quack"  appears
	    should be replaced with the animal's noise.

	    You will receive a paltry bonus if  your  function  displays
	    the correct article (either a or an)  depending  on  whether
	    the name or noise begins with a consonant or a vowel.
