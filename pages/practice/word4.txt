	4.  Develop and code a class, named Bottle, with  the  following
	    publicly accessible characteristics:

	     - when an  instance  of  a  Bottle  is  created,  a  double
	       (indicating the capacity of the Bottle) and  a  character
	       string  (indicating  the  unit  of  capacity,   max.   30
	       characters) must be supplied. A  new  Bottle  starts  out
	       empty.

	     - there is a member function
		 double fill(double)
	       which is passed an amount to be poured into  the  Bottle.
	       This is added to the amount already in the Bottle, unless
	       the total would exceed the capacity  of  the  Bottle,  in
	       which case only enough to fill the Bottle is  added.  The
	       amount left over, if any, is returned.

	     - there is a member function
		 double fullness()
	       which returns, as a percent, how full the Bottle is.

	     - there is a member function
		 void display()
	       which displays the current state of the  Bottle,  in  the
	       following format:
		 This 5.00 Litre bottle has 4.50 Litres in it.
	       (where this particular Bottle has a capacity  of  5.0,  a
	       unit of "Litre" and has had 4.5 poured into it).

	    For example, the following program:
		int main()
		{
		    Bottle x(3.5, "Gallon");
		    double spill = 0;

		    while (spill == 0) {
			spill = x.fill(0.75);
			x.display();
		    }
		    printf("Oops! We spilled %.2lf!\n", spill);
		    printf("Bottle is %.2lf%% full.\n", x.fullness());
		    return 0;
		}
	    would display:
		This 3.50 Gallon bottle has 0.75 Gallons in it.
		This 3.50 Gallon bottle has 1.50 Gallons in it.
		This 3.50 Gallon bottle has 2.25 Gallons in it.
		This 3.50 Gallon bottle has 3.00 Gallons in it.
		This 3.50 Gallon bottle has 3.50 Gallons in it.
		Oops! We spilled 0.25!
		Bottle is 100.00% full.
