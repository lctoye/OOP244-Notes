	18. Write the code to implement  a  class  called  an  occasion,
	    which  stores  information  about   an   up-coming   special
	    occasion. An occasion has the following publicly  accessible
	    characteristics:
		- a member function
		    int date(int day, int month, int year)
		  which sets the date on which the occasion will  occur.
		  This function performs a SIMPLE check of the  supplied
		  data (to make sure that day is 1-31, month is 1-12 and
		  year is 1900-9999). If the data is OK, the  occasion's
		  date is set as requested and a true value is returned.
		  Otherwise, the occasion's date is set  to  January  1,
		  1980 and a false value is returned.
		- a member function
		    void set(char s[])
		  which sets the description for the  occasion  to  (the
		  null- terminated string) s.
		- a member function
		    long date()
		  which  returns  the  occasion's  date  in  the  format
		  yyyymmdd (e.g. 19960315 for March 15, 1996).
		- a member function
		    char *tell(char s[])
		  which extracts the occasion's description  and  places
		  it in s as a null-terminated string. For  convenience,
		  this function also returns s.
		- when instantiated, the  default  date  is  January  1,
		  1980, and the default description is an empty  string.
		  Additionally, three ints (day, month, year) and a char
		  string (description) may be supplied,  in  which  case
		  the occasion is initialized according to the rules  in
		  date(int, int, int) and set(char []) above.
		- the == operator may be used to compare two  occasions.
		  Two occasions are considered equal if  they  occur  on
		  the  same  date.  (I.e.  the  descriptions   for   the
		  occasions have nothing to do  with  whether  they  are
		  equal or not).

	    For  example,  the  following  program  reads  a   file   of
	    occassions, and displays the description for every  occasion
	    that occured on November 5, 1996:

		int read(FILE *fp, occasion *p) // read an occasion from file
		{   int rc = 0, d, m, y;        // returns true if successful
		    char s[81];
		    if (4 == fscanf(fp, "%d/%d/%d %80[^\n]", &d, &m, &y, s))
			if (p->date(d, m, y)) {
			    p->set(s);
			    rc = 1;
			}
		    return rc;
		}

		int main()
		{   FILE *fp = fopen("occasion.dat", "r");
		    occasion today(5, 11, 1996, "Today"), x;
		    char desc[81];
		    while (read(fp, &x))
			if (x == today)
			    printf("%s\n", x.tell(desc));
		    fclose(fp);
		    return 0;
		}
