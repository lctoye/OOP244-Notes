	10. Write a class, named property, which is used by the Megacity
	    to store the property tax information for a house.

	    When instantiated, a property must be  supplied  an  address
	    (char string no longer  than  60  characters),  and  may  be
	    supplied  an  assessed  value  (double)  and  a  mill   rate
	    (double). (Either both numeric values will be supplied after
	    the address, or no numeric values will be supplied).  If  no
	    numeric values are  supplied,  then  an  assessed  value  of
	    $100,000.00 and a mill rate of 1.0 are to be  used.  If,  on
	    the other hand, values are supplied but they are  less  than
	    zero, then 0.0 is to be  used  in  place  of  the  offending
	    value(s).

	    There are member functions:

	       int mill(double) - if the double value passed is  greater
		   than or equal to zero, then the  mill  rate  for  the
		   property is reset to be that value, and a true  value
		   is returned. Otherwise, nothing is  done  other  than
		   returning a false value.

	       double mill() - returns the current  mill  rate  for  the
		   property.

	       int assessed(double) - if  the  double  value  passed  is
		   greater than or equal  to  zero,  then  the  assessed
		   value for the property is reset to be that value, and
		   a true value is returned. Otherwise, nothing is  done
		   other than returning a false value.

	       double assessed() - returns the current assessed value of
		   the property.

		void address(char s[]) - fills  the  array  s  with  the
		   address of the property.

		double taxes() - returns  the  annual  taxes   for   the
		   property, which is  the  result  of  multiplying  the
		   assessed value by the mill rate,  and  then  dividing
		   that by 100.

	    As well, a double may be added to (using +),  or  subtracted
	    from (using -), a property,  which  results  in  a  property
	    identical to the supplied property, except that its assessed
	    value is the sum (using +) or difference (using  -)  of  the
	    assessed value (of the supplied property) and  the  supplied
	    double. However, if  this  calculation  would  result  in  a
	    negative assessed value, then the  resulting  property  will
	    have an assessed value of 0.0.

	    For example,

		property x("1 Main St."), y("2 Main St.", 130000.00, 1.1);
		x.mill(1.24);
		printf("%.2lf %.2lf\n", x.taxes(), y.taxes());
		x = x + 10000.00;
		char addr[61];
		x.address(addr);
		printf("Tax for %s is now %.2lf\n", addr, x.taxes());

	    would display:

		1240.00 1430.00
		Tax for 1 Main St. is now 1364.00
