	12. Code a class called tvshow, which stores information about a
	    TV show. When instantiated, two character strings (title  of
	    the show and name of the network on which the show  appears)
	    and an  int  (the  Kneelson  rating  of  the  show)  may  be
	    supplied.

	    If the title is longer than 50 characters, only the first 50
	    characters are stored, and if the  network  name  is  longer
	    than 20 characters only the first 20 characters are stored.

	    Alternatively,  a  tvshow  may   be   instantiated   without
	    supplying any data, in which case an empty  string  is  used
	    for the show's title as well as the network's name, and 0 is
	    used for the Kneelson rating.

	    There are public member functions:
		void title(char s[])
		    which copies the show's title into the array s, as a
		    null- terminated string.
		void network(char s[])
		    which copies the network's name into  the  array  s,
		    also as a null-terminated string.
		int rating()
		    which returns the Kneelson rating for the show.

	     As well, two tvshows may be compared using >, which returns
	     a true value if the Kneelson rating of the  tvshow  on  the
	     left side is higher than the Kneelson rating of the  tvshow
	     on the right side.

	     Similarly, a tvshow can be compared to an int  value  using
	     >, where the tvshow's Kneelson rating is  compared  to  the
	     int.

	     Finally, there is a non-member function
		  tvshow best(tvshow x[], int count)
	     which is passed an array of tvshows along with  the  number
	     of elements in the array, and returns the element with  the
	     highest Kneelson rating.

	     For example
		tvshow shows[3], top;
		shows[0] = tvshow("This Hour Has 22 Minutes", "CBC", 15);
		shows[1] = tvshow("Frasier", "NBC", 30);
		shows[2] = tvshow("Beavis and Butthead", "MuchMusic", 1);
		top = best(shows, 3);
		char s1[51], s2[21];
		top.title(s1);
		top.network(s2);
		printf("%s on %s tops ratings at %d\n",s1,s2,top.rating());
	    displays
		Frasier on NBC tops ratings at 30
