	24. Code three classes: publication, periodical and book,  where
	    periodical and book are both derived from publication.

	    A publication stores the  following  information,  which  is
	    common to any publication (including periodicals and books):

		- Title (char string, max length 60 characters)

		- Publisher (char string, max length 40 characters)

	    A periodical additionally stores a  string  (max  length  20
	    characters) which contains a description of  how  often  the
	    periodical is published, such as  "Monthly"  or  "Daily"  or
	    "Every Three Weeks".

	    A book additionally stores:

		- Author (char string, max length 80 characters)

		- ISBN number (char string, max length 20 characters)

	    When instantiating one of these classes, data  for  each  of
	    the fields (specified above) must be supplied. (See  example
	    below for the order).

	    The  only  public  feature  of  these  classes,  other  than
	    construction  (and  destruction,  if   your   implementation
	    requires it), is that instances of each of these classes may
	    be sent to any ostream using the << operator  (in  a  manner
	    similar  to  the  built-in  types).   Additionally,   if   a
	    periodical or book is sent to  an  ostream  using  <<  in  a
	    publication context, the additional information pertinent to
	    the periodical  or  book  is  shown,  in  a  format  exactly
	    matching that of the example below.

	      [Hint: this last specification implies that the display 
	      action must be "virtual". But the << operator cannot be 
	      virtual, since it cannot be a member.  Therefore,  your 
	      << operator will need  to  call  one  or  more  virtual 
	      functions to do the actual display work. This function, 
	      or set of functions, should be private or protected, to
	      fully  meet  the  requirements  outlined  above.   Look 
	      carefully at ALL the output below  before designing the 
	      code to perform output in the base class.]

	    For example, the following program:

		int main() {
		    publication *p[3];
		    p[0] = new
		     publication("OOP244 Notes", "Seneca College");
		    p[1] = new 
		     periodical("Toronto Sun", "Southam News", "Daily");
		    p[2] = new 
		     book("21 Days to a Better You", "Pretice Hall",
		     "Joseph Noodlemeyer", "1-234-5546-3");

		    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
			cout << *p[i] << '\n';
			delete p[i];
		    }
		    return 0;
		}

	    would output:

		Publication: OOP244 Notes
		Published by Seneca College

		Periodical: Toronto Sun
		Published Daily by Southam News

		Book: 21 Days to a Better You
		Published by Prentice Hall
		Written by Joseph Noodlemeyer
		ISBN: 1-234-5546-3
