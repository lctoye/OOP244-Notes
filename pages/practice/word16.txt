	16. Create a class, called a Buffer, that  can  store  up  to  4
	    strings destined for output. Each string has a maximum  size
	    of 81 bytes. A Buffer has the following characteristics:

		- when a Buffer is created, it is empty.

		- the operator, <<, may have a Buffer on the  left  side
		  and a character string on the right side.  The  string
		  is stored in the Buffer. If the Buffer is  full  (i.e.
		  this is the fourth string that has  been  sent  to  an
		  empty Buffer) then all the strings in the  Buffer  are
		  displayed on the screen (with a  new-line  after  each
		  one) and the Buffer is made empty.

		- there is a member function

			void flush()

		  that displays all the strings in the  Buffer  (with  a
		  new-line after each one) and the Buffer is made empty.

		- when a Buffer disappears, any strings stored in it are
		  displayed with a new-line after each one).

	    For example, the following code:       produces this output:

	    {   Buffer x;                         123hi
		x << "hi";                        hello
		printf("1");                      morning
		x << "hello";                     greetings
		printf("2");                      45howdy
		x << "morning";                   yo!
		printf("3");                      6hey
		x << "greetings";                 bye
		printf("4");                      
		x << "howdy";
		printf("5");
		x << "yo!";
		x.flush();
		x << "hey";
		printf("6");
		x << "bye";
	    }
