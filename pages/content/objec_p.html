       <p>
       Object-oriented programming reflects the way in which
       we manage day-to-day tasks.&nbsp; Professor Miller of Princeton
       University demonstrated that most of us can only comprehend about seven
       chunks of information at a time.&#160; As children, we learn to play with
       small sets of chunks at an early age.&nbsp; As we grow, we learn to break
       down the problems that we face into sets of manageable chunks.&nbsp; </p>

       <p>
       A chunk in object-oriented programming is called an <i>object</i>.&#160;
       The shared structure of a set of similar objects is called their <i>class</i>.&nbsp;
       This shared structure includes the structure
       of the data in the similar objects as well as the logic that works on that
       data.&nbsp;
       </p>
       <p>
       This chapter introduces the concepts of object, class,
       encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.&nbsp; Subsequent chapters
       elaborate on each concept in detail.
       </p>
       <br />

       <p id="abs" class="section">Abstraction</p>

       <p>
       Programming solutions to application problems consist of components.&nbsp;
       The process of designing these solutions involves <i>abstraction</i>.&nbsp;
       In the C programming language, we abstract common code, store it in a structure
       or function and refer to that structure or function from possibly multiple places
       in our source code, thereby avoiding code duplication.&nbsp;
       </p>
       <p>
       An object-oriented programming solution to an application problem consists of components
       called objects.&#160; The process of designing an object-oriented
       solution likewise involves <i>abstraction</i>.&nbsp; We distinguish the most important
       features of the object, identify them publicly and hide the less important
       details within the object itself.&#160;
       </p>
       <br />

       <p class="center"><img src="../images/abstraction.png" width="249"
       height="156" alt="entity" /></p>
       <br />

       <p>
       Each object has a crisp conceptual boundary and acts in ways appropriate to itself.&#160;
       Compare a book with a set of notes.&nbsp;
       A book has pages that are bound and can be flipped.&nbsp; The page order is fixed.&nbsp;
       A set of notes consists of loose pages that can be rearranged in any order.&#160; We
       represent the book as an object and the set of notes as another object;
       each object has a different structure.</p>

       <p>
       The <span class="code">cout</span> and <span class="code">cin</span> objects introduced
       in the preceding chapter are examples.&nbsp; They have different structures.&#160;
       <span class="code">cout</span> represents the standard output
       device, which may be a monitor or a printer.&#160;
       The abstraction - the standard output device - is simple and crisp.&#160;
       Internally, the <span class="code">cout</span> object is quite complex.&nbsp;
       On the other hand, <span class="code">cin</span> represents the standard input
       device, which may be a keyboard, a tablet or a touch screen.&#160; The abstraction
       - the standard input device - is also simple and crisp.&#160; Internally, the
       <span class="code">cin</span> object is also quite complex.</p>
       <br />

       <p id="cla" class="section">Classes</p>

       <p>
       We describe the structure of similar objects in terms of their
       <i>class</i>.&nbsp; Objects of the same class have the same
       structure, but possibly different states.&nbsp; The variable types that describe
       their states are identical, but generally have different values.&nbsp; For example,
       all of the books in the figure above have a title and an author, but each book has
       a different title and a different author.&nbsp;
       </p>

       <p class="center"><img src="../images/classes.png" width="264"
       height="205" alt="classes" /></p>

       <p>
       We say that each object is an <i>instance</i> of its class.&nbsp;
       </p>

       <p class="ssection">UML</p>

       <p>The Unified Modelling Language (UML) is a general-purpose modeling language
       developed for describing systems of objects and relationships between their classes.&#160;
       This language defines standard symbols for classes and their relationships.&#160;
       The connectors shown in the relationship diagram below are UML connectors.&nbsp; We use
       these symbols in this text.
       </p>

       <p class="center"><img src="../images/class_relationships.png"
        width="252" height="72" alt="class relationships" /></p>

       <p class="sssection">The Class Diagram</p>

       <p>
       The primary graphic in UML is the <em>class diagram</em>:
       a rectangular box with three compartments:</p>

       <ol>
        <li>the upper compartment identifies the class by its name</li>

        <li>the middle compartment identifies the names and types of
        its attributes</li>

        <li>the lower compartment identifies the names, return types and
        parameter types of its operations</li>
       </ol>

       <p>
       For example,
       </p>

       <table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" border="1" class="center"
       summary="">
        <tr class="desc">
         <td>
          <div class="center code">
           Code
          </div>
         </td>
        </tr>

        <tr class="value">
         <td align="left" class=code>&#160;number : int &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;title : char*&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>

        <tr class="blue">
         <td align="left" class=code>&#160;getCode() : int&#160;<br />&nbsp;getTitle() : const char*&nbsp;<br />
         &#160;setCode(int) : void&#160;<br />&nbsp;setTitle(const char*) : void&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
       </table>

       <p>The naming conventions include:</p>

       <ul>
        <li>begin each class name with an upper case letter</li>

        <li>begin each member name with a lower case letter</li>

        <li>use camel case throughout all names - capitalize the first letter
        of every word after the first word</li>
       </ul>

       <p class="sssection">Terminology</p>

       <p>
       UML uses the terms attributes and operations.&nbsp; Some object-oriented
       languages use different terms.&nbsp; Equivalent terms are:
       </p>
       <ul>
       <li>attributes (UML) -&gt; fields, data members, properties, member variables</li>
       <li>operations (UML) -&gt; methods (Java), procedures, messages, member functions</li>
       </ul>
       <p>
       The C++ language standard uses the terms <i>data members</i> and <i>member functions</i> exclusively.
       </p>

       <br />

       <p id="enc" class="section">Encapsulation</p>

       <p>
       <i>Encapsulation</i> is the primary concept of object-oriented programming.&nbsp;
       It refers to the integration of data and logic within a class' implementation that
       establishes the crisp interface between the implementation and any client.&nbsp;
       Encapsulation maintains high cohesion within a class and low coupling between
       the class' implementation and any one of its clients.&nbsp;
       </p>
       <p>
       A class definition declares the variables and the function prototypes.&nbsp;
       The variables store each object's data and the functions contain the logic
       that operates on that data.&nbsp; Clients access objects through calls to
       these functions without knowledge of the data stored within the objects or
       the logic that manipulates that data.&nbsp;
       </p>

       <p class="center"><img src="../images/encapsulation.png" width=
       "301" height="79" alt="encapsulation" /></p>

       <p>
       Encapsulation shields the complex details of a class' implementation from
       its interface; that is, its crisp external representation.&#160;
       Consider the following statement from the preceding chapter:
       </p>

       <table width="45%" summary="">
        <tr>
         <td>
          <pre class="high">
 cout &lt;&lt; "Welcome to Object-Oriented";
</pre>
         </td>
        </tr>
       </table>

       <p>
       <span class=code>cout</span> refers to the standard output object.&nbsp;
       Its class defines how to store the object's data in memory and how to control the
       operations that work with that data.&nbsp; The <span class=code>&lt;&lt;</span>
       operator copies the string to the output object without exposing any of the
       implementation details.&nbsp; As client programmers, we only see the interface
       that manages the output process.
       </p>

       <p>
       A well-encapsulated class hides all implementation details within itself.&#160;
       The client does not see the data that the class' object stores within itself or the
       logic that it uses to manage its internal data.&nbsp; The client only sees a clean
       and simple interface to the object.&#160;
       </p>

       <p>
       As long as the classes in a programming solution are well-encapsulated,
       any programmer can upgrade the internal structure of any object developed
       by another programmer without changing any client code.&#160;</p>

       <br />

       <p id="loo" class="section">Inheritance and Polymorphism</p>

       <p>
       Two object-oriented concepts are prominent in our
       study of the relationships between classes:&nbsp;
       </p>
       <ul>
       <li><a href="inher.html">Inheritance</a> - one class inherits the structure of another class</li>
       <li><a href="adhoc.html">Polymorphism</a> - a single interface provides multiple implementations</li>
       </ul>
       <p>
       These are special cases of encapsulation in the sense of distinguishing
       interface and implementation to produce highly cohesive objects
       that support minimal coupling to their clients.&nbsp;
       </p>
       <br />

       <p class="ssection">Inheritance</p>

       <p>
       Inheritance relates classes that share the same structure.&nbsp;
       In the Figure below, the <span class="code">Hybrid Course</span>
       class inherits the entire structure of the <span class="code">Course</span> class
       and adds some further structure.&#160;
       We say that the hybrid course '<em>is-a-kind-of</em>' <span class="code">Course</span> and
       depict the inheritance relationship using an arrow drawn from the
       more specialized class to the more general class:</p>

       <p class="center"><img src="../images/isahierarchy.png" width=
       "61" height="73" alt="is a kind of hierarchy" /></p>

       <p>
       Inheriting one class from another allows us to utilize existing technology.&nbsp;
       We only provide the code that implements additional structure.
       </p>
       <p class="ssection">Polymorphism</p>

       <p>
       Polymorphism relates the implementation for an object based on its
       type.&nbsp; In the Figure below, the <span class=code>HybridCourse</span> object
       involves a different mode of delivery than the <span class=code>Course</span> object,
       but the same assessments.&nbsp; Both objects belong to the same hierarchy:
       both are <span class=code>Course</span> objects.&nbsp;
       </p>
       <p>
       A <span class=code>mode()</span>
       query on a <span class=code>Course</span> type reports a different result than a
       <span class=code>mode()</span> query on a <span class=code>Hybrid Course</span> type.&nbsp;
       On the other hand, an <span class=code>assessments()</span> query
       on a <span class=code>Course</span> type reports the same result as
       on an <span class=code>HybridCourse</span> type.&#160;
       </p>

       <p class="center"><img src="../images/differentBehavior.png"
       width="256" height="120" alt="different behavior polymorphism" />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       <img src="../images/identicalBehavior.png"
       width="256" height="120" alt="identical behavior polymorphism" />
       </p>
       <p>
       Polymorphic programming allows us to minimize the duplication of code amongst
       objects that belong to the same inheritance hierarchy.
       </p>

       <p class="ssection">The Three Musketeers</p>

       <p>
       Encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism are the cornerstones of any object-oriented programming language.
       </p>

       <br />

       <p id="sum" class="section">Summary</p>

       <ul>
       <li>An object is a chunk of information with a crisp conceptual boundary
       and a well-defined structure.</li>

       <li>
       Objects are abstractions of the most important chunks
       of information from a problem domain.&nbsp;
       They distinguish the different feature sets in the problem domain.&#160;
       </li>

       <li>A class describes the structure common to a
       set of similar objects.&nbsp; Each object in the set is a single instance
       of its class.</li>

       <li>Encapsulation hides the implementation details within a class - the
       internal data and internal logic are invisible to client applications that use
       objects of that class.&#160;</li>

       <li>
       We can upgrade the structure of a well-encapsulated class
       without altering any client code.
