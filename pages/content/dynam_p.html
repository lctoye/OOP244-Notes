       <p>
       Various components of object-oriented programs can be reused by other
       applications.&nbsp; An important aspect of object designing is including flexibility
       in their memory requirements to enhance reusability.&nbsp; Objects are more reusable
       by different clients if they account for their own memory needs internally.&nbsp;
       These memory requirements may depend on problem size, which might not even be
       known approximately at compile-time.&nbsp; Programming languages address this
       aspect of reusability by supporting dynamic memory allocation.&nbsp;
       </p>

       <p>
       This chapter introduces the C++ syntax for allocating and deallocating
       memory dynamically.&nbsp; The chapter entitled <a href="deepc.html">Classes
       and Resources</a> augments this material with the details required to code
       classes that manage dynamic memory internally.
       </p>
       <br />

       <p id="ove" class="section">Static and Dynamic Memory</p>

       <p>
       The memory accessible by a C++ program throughout its execution consists of
       static and dynamic components.&nbsp; After the user starts an application,
       the operating system loads its executable into RAM and transfers control to
       that executable's entry point (the <span class=code>main()</span> function).&#160;
       The loaded executable only includes the memory allocated at compile time.&nbsp;
       During execution, the application may request more memory from the
       operating system.&nbsp; The system satisfies such requests by allocating
       more memory in RAM.&nbsp; After the application terminates and returns control to
       the operating system, the system recovers all of the memory that the application
       has used.&#160; </p>

       <p class="ssection">Static Memory</p>

       <p>
       The memory that the operating system allocates for the application at
       load time is called <i>static memory</i>.&#160; Static memory includes
       the memory allocated for program instructions and program data.&#160; The
       compiler determines the amount of static memory that each translation unit
       requires.&nbsp; The linker determines the amount of static memory that the
       entire application requires.&#160;</p>

       <p class="center"><img src="../images/static&#32;memory.png" width=
       "247" height="63" alt="arrays in dynamic memory" /></p>

       <p>
       The application's variables and objects share static memory amongst
       themselves.&nbsp; When a variable or object goes out of scope its memory
       becomes available for newly defined variables or objects.&nbsp;
       The lifetime of each local variable and object concludes at the closing
       brace of the code block within which it has been defined:&#160;</p>

       <table width="45%" summary="">
        <tr>
         <td>
          <pre>
 // lifetime of a local variable or object

 for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
     <span class=
"high">double x = 0;      // lifetime of x starts here</span>
     // ...
 }                      <span class=
"high">// lifetime of x ends here</span>

 for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
     <span class=
"high">double y = 4;      // lifetime of y starts here&nbsp;</span>
     // ...
 }                      <span class=
"high">// lifetime of y ends here</span>
</pre>
         </td>
        </tr>
       </table>

       <p>
       Since the variable <span class=code>x</span> goes out of scope
       before the variable <span class=code>y</span> is declared, the
       two variables may occupy the same memory location.&nbsp;
       This system of sharing memory amongst local variables and objects
       ensures that each application minimizes its use of RAM.
       </p>
       <p>
       Static memory requirements are determined at compile-link time and
       do not change during execution.&nbsp; This memory is fast, fixed in
       its amount and allocated at load time.&nbsp;
       </p>

       <p class="ssection">Dynamic Memory</p>

       <p>
       The memory that an application obtains from the operating system during
       execution is called <i>dynamic memory</i>.&#160;</p>

       <p>
       Dynamic memory is distinct from the static memory.&nbsp; While the
       operating system allocates static memory for an application at load
       time, the system reserves dynamic memory, allocates it and deallocates
       it at run-time.&nbsp;
       </p>

       <p class="sssection">Scope Considerations</p>

       <p>
       To keep track of an application's dynamic memory, we store the address
       of each allocated region in a pointer variable.&nbsp; We allocate memory
       for this pointer itself in static memory.&nbsp; This pointer variable
       must remain in scope as long as we need access to the data in the allocated
       region of dynamic memory.&nbsp;</p>

       <p>
       Consider allocating dynamic memory for an array of n elements.&#160;
       We store the array's address in a pointer, <span class=code>p</span>, in
       static memory as illustrated below.&#160; We allocate memory for the elements
       of the array dynamically and store the data in those elements starting at
       address <span class=code>p</span>.</p>

       <p class="center"><img src="../images/dynamic&#32;memory.png" width=
       "205" height="114" alt="arrays in dynamic memory" /></p>

       <p class="ssection">Lifetime</p>

       <p>The lifetime of any dynamically allocated memory ends when the
       pointer holding its address goes out of scope.&nbsp; The application
       must explicitly deallocate the allocated region of dynamic memory
       within this scope.&#160; If the application neglects to deallocate
       the allocated region, that memory becomes inaccessible and irrecoverable
       until the application returns control to the operating system.&nbsp;
       </p>
       <p>
       Unlike variables and objects that have been allocated in static memory,
       those in dynamic memory do not automatically go of out scope at the
       closing brace of the code block within which they were defined.&#160;
       We must manage their deallocation explicitly ourselves.</p>
       <br />

       <p id="ne_" class="section">Dynamic Allocation</p>

       <p>The keyword <span class="code">new</span> followed by
       <span class="code">[n]</span> allocates contiguous memory
       dynamically for an array of <span class="code">n</span>
       elements and returns the address of the array's first element.&#160;
       </p>
       <p>
       Dynamic allocation of arrays takes the form</p>
       <pre class="defin">
 <i>pointer</i> = new <i>Type</i>[<i>size</i>];
</pre>

       <p>where <span class=code><i>Type</i></span> is the type of the array's elements.&nbsp;
       </p>
       <p>
       For example, to allocate dynamic memory for an array of
       <span class=code>n</span> <span class="code">Student</span>s, we write</p>

       <table width="45%" summary="">
        <tr>
         <td>
          <pre>
 int n;                      // the number of students
 Student* student = nullptr; // the address of the dynamic array&nbsp;

 cout &lt;&lt; "How many students in this section? ";
 cin &gt;&gt; n;

 student = <span class="high">new</span> Student<span class=
"high">[n]</span>;   // allocates dynamic memory
</pre>
         </td>
        </tr>
       </table>

       <p>
       The <span class="code">nullptr</span> keyword identifies the address pointed
       to as the null address.&nbsp; This keyword is an implementation constant.&nbsp;
       Initialization to <span class="code">nullptr</span> ensures that <span class="code">student</span>
       is not pointing to any valid dereferencable address.&#160; The size of the array
       is a run-time variable and not an integer constant or constant expression.&nbsp;
       Note that the size of an array allocated in static memory must be an integer constant
       or constant expression.&#160;</p>
       <br />

       <p id="de_" class="section">Dynamic Deallocation</p>

       <p>The keyword <span class="code">delete</span> followed by
       <span class="code">[]</span> and the address of a dynamically allocated region of
       memory deallocates the memory that the corresponding <span class="code">new[]</span>
       operator had allocated.&#160;
       </p>
       <p>
       Dynamic deallocation of arrays takes the form</p>
       <pre class="defin">
 delete [] <i>pointer</i>;
</pre>
       <p>where <span class=code><i>pointer</i></span> holds the address
       of the dynamically allocated array.&nbsp;
       </p>

       <p>
       For example, to deallocate the memory allocated for the array of
       <span class=code>n</span> <span class="code">Student</span>s
       above, we write</p>

       <table width="45%" summary="">
        <tr>
         <td>
          <pre>
 <span class="high">delete []</span> student;
 student = nullptr;  // optional
</pre>
         </td>
        </tr>
       </table>

       <p>
       The <span class=
       "code">nullptr</span> assignment ensures that <span class=
       "code">student</span> now holds the null address.&nbsp;
       This optional assignment eliminates the possibility of deleting the original
       address a second time, which is a serious run-time error.&#160;
       Deleting the <span class="code">nullptr</span> address has no effect.</p>

       <p>
       Note that omitting the brackets in a deallocation expression deallocates the first
       element of the array, leaving the other elements inaccessible.&#160;</p>

       <p>
       Deallocation does not return dynamic memory to the operating system.&#160;
       The deallocated  memory remains available for subsequent dynamic allocations.&#160;
       The operating system only reclaims all of the dynamically allocated memory once
       the application has returned control to the system.&#160;</p>

       <p class="ssection">A Complete Example</p>

       <p>Consider a simple program in which the user enters a number and the program
       allocates memory for that number of <span class="code">Student</span>s.&nbsp;
       The user then enters data for each student.&nbsp; The program displays the data
       stored, deallocates the memory and terminates:</p>

       <table width="45%" summary="">
        <tr>
         <td>
          <pre>
 // Dynamic Memory Allocation

 #include &lt;iostream&gt;

 using namespace std;

 struct Student {
     int no;
     float grade[2];
 };

 int main( ) {
     int n;
     <span class=high>Student* student = nullptr</span>;

     cout &lt;&lt; "Enter the number of students : ";&nbsp;
     cin &gt;&gt; n;
     <span class=high>student = new Student[n]</span>;

     for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
         cout &lt;&lt; "Student Number: ";

       <p id="all" class="section">Memory Issues</p>

       <p>
       Issues regarding dynamic memory allocation and deallocation include:
       </p>
       <ol>
       <li>memory leaks</li>
       <li>insufficient memory</li>
       </ol>

       <p class="ssection">Memory Leak</p>

       <p>
       Memory leaks are one of the most important bugs in object-oriented programming.&nbsp;
       A memory leak occurs if an application loses the address of dynamically
       allocated memory before that memory has been deallocated.&#160; This may
       occur if</p>

       <ul>
        <li>the pointer to dynamic memory goes out of scope before
        the application deallocates that memory&#160;</li>

        <li>the pointer to dynamic memory changes its value before
        the application deallocates the memory starting at the address
        stored in that pointer&#160;</li>
       </ul>

       <p>Memory leaks are difficult to find because they often do not halt
       execution immediately.&nbsp; We might only become aware of
       their existence indirectly through subsequently incorrect results or
       progressively slower execution.&#160;</p>

       <p class="ssection">Insufficient Memory</p>

       <p>
       On small platforms where memory is severely limited, a realistic possibility
       exists that the operating system might not be able to provide the amount of
       dynamic memory requested.&#160;
       If the operating system cannot dynamically allocate the requested memory, the
       application may throw an exception and stop executing.&nbsp; The topic of
       exception handling is beyond the scope of these notes.&nbsp; One method of
       trapping a failure to allocate memory is described in the chapter entitled
       <a ref="ansis.html">The ISO/IEC Standard</a>.</p>

       <br />

       <p id="new" class="section">Single Instances <script type="text/javascript" src="../optional.js"></script></p>

       <p>
       Although dynamic memory is often allocated for data structures like arrays,
       we can also allocate dynamic memory for single instances of any type.&nbsp;
       The allocation and deallocation syntax is similar to that for arrays.&#160;
       We simply remove the brackets.</p>

       <p class="ssection">Allocation</p>

       <p>
       The keyword <span class="code">new</span>
       without brackets allocates dynamic memory for a single
       variable or object.&#160;
       </p>
       <p>
       A dynamic allocation statement takes the form</p>
       <pre class="defin">
 <i>pointer</i> = new <i>Type</i>;
</pre>

       <p>
       For example, to store one instance of a <span class=
       "code">Student</span> in dynamic memory, we write</p>

       <table width="45%" summary="">
        <tr>
         <td>
          <pre>
 Student* harry = nullptr;   // a pointer in static memory
 harry = <span class=
"high">new</span> Student;        // points to a Student in dynamic memory&nbsp;

 // we must deallocate harry later!
</pre>
         </td>
        </tr>
       </table>

       <p class="center"><img src="../images/single&#32;instance.png" width="205"
       height="113" alt="single instance dynamic memory" /></p>

       <p class="ssection">Deallocation</p>

       <p>The keyword <span class="code">delete</span> without
       brackets deallocates dynamic memory at the address specified.&#160;
       </p>
       <p>
       A dynamic deallocation statement takes the form</p>
       <pre class="defin">
 delete <i>pointer</i>;
</pre>

       <p><span class="code">delete</span> takes the address that
       was returned by the <span class="code">new</span> operator.</p>

       <p>
       For example, to deallocate the memory for <span class=code>harry</span>, we write</p>

       <table width="45%" summary="">
        <tr>
         <td>
          <pre>
 <span class="high">delete</span> harry;
 harry = nullptr;  // good programming style&nbsp;
